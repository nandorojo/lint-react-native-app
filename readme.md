# lint-react-native-app

A command-line interface that adds linting and prettier to a `react` / `react-native` project. It primarily targets `expo`.

## Install

Run this after running `expo init` (or from `react-native` cli):

```bash
$ npx lint-expo-app
```

This will create a `prettierrc.json` and `.eslintrc.json` file for you.

It supports TypeScript, React Hooks linters, and other recommended react / react-native linter dependencies.
